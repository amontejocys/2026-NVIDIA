## 2. The Architecture
**Owner:** Project Lead

### Choice of Quantum Algorithm
* **Algorithm:** QAOA (p=1-2)
    
* **Motivation:** 
    * We selected QAOA because it was designed for combinatory optimizations, with a lower p (depth), we can have a very short and stable circuit. It's ideal as generator of bitstrings.
    *  LABS can be expreseed as sum of terms Z_i and Z_j and terms of mayor locality (like G4), QAOA applies an operator with same locality as objective, that's coincidence permits QAOA resolve the case
    * *Better time to seed, lower time to optimization*: This process uses lower optimization cost, selecting a quantum seeder sample, with a shor depth, the process to get the best bitstring becomes easy
    * Works well with noisy computers
   

### Literature Review
* **Reference:** Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), Farhi, Goldstone & Gutmann (2014)
* **Relevance:** 
    * Justifies the use of QAOA with low depth circuits

* **Reference:** [Title, Author, Link]
* **Relevance:** [How does this paper support your plan?]
    * *Example:* "Reference: 'QAOA for MaxCut.' Relevance: Although LABS is different from MaxCut, this paper demonstrates how parameter concentration can speed up optimization, which we hope to replicate."

## 3. The Acceleration Strategy
Owner: Prem Santh CK (GPU Acceleration Lead)

**Quantum Acceleration (CUDA-Q)Strategy**: We aren't just running code; we’re optimizing for the hardware. Prem Santh is leading the transition from CPU-bound logic to the CUDA-Q nvidia backend. During our initial phase, we successfully debugged our custom QAOA kernels and passed a rigorous Pi-Rotation Consistency Test to ensure our basis-changes were physically accurate. As we scale to larger $N$, we will utilize FP32 precision to keep our state-vectors lean. If we hit memory limits, we will deploy the nvidia-mgpu backend to distribute the circuit workload across multiple GPUs, ensuring our "Quantum Seeder" stays fast and reliable.

 **Classical Acceleration (MTS)**
**Strategy**: We identified that calculating energy for every bit-flip one-by-one was our primary bottleneck. To overcome this, Prem Santh is overseeing the vectorization of our autocorrelation math using CuPy. Instead of a slow serial approach, we are building a "parallel highway" to evaluate entire batches of sequence neighbors simultaneously on the GPU. This transforms our Memetic Tabu Search from a slow crawl into a high-speed refinement engine that can "polish" quantum seeds in milliseconds.

 **Hardware TargetsDev Environment:** Qbraid (CPU) was used to build our core logic, while the Brev L4 served as our proving ground to ensure our kernels were "hardware-ready" by passing all internal symmetry and rotation validation tests.Production Environment: For the final push to $N=40$ and beyond, we are targeting the Brev A100 (80GB) to leverage its massive memory bandwidth for deep Trotterized QAOA circuits and high-throughput classical refinement.

## 4. The Verification Plan
**Owner:** Quality Assurance PIC

### Unit Testing Strategy
* **Framework:** [e.g., `pytest`, `unittest`]
* **AI Hallucination Guardrails:** [How do you know the AI code is right?]
    * *Example:* "We will require AI-generated kernels to pass a 'property test' (Hypothesis library) ensuring outputs are always within theoretical energy bounds before they are integrated."

### Core Correctness Checks
* **Check 1 (Symmetry):** [Describe a specific physics check]
    * *Example:* "LABS sequence $S$ and its negation $-S$ must have identical energies. We will assert `energy(S) == energy(-S)`."
* **Check 2 (Ground Truth):**
    * *Example:* "For $N=3$, the known optimal energy is 1.0. Our test suite will assert that our GPU kernel returns exactly 1.0 for the sequence `[1, 1, -1]`."

## 5. Execution Strategy & Success Metrics
**Owner:** Technical Marketing PIC

### Agentic Workflow
* **Plan:** [How will you orchestrate your tools?]
    * *Example:* "We are using Cursor as the IDE. We have created a `skills.md` file containing the CUDA-Q documentation so the agent doesn't hallucinate API calls. The QA Lead runs the tests, and if they fail, pastes the error log back into the Agent to refactor."

### Success Metrics
* **Metric 1 (Approximation):** [e.g., Target Ratio > 0.9 for N=30]
* **Metric 2 (Speedup):** [e.g., 10x speedup over the CPU-only Tutorial baseline]
* **Metric 3 (Scale):** [e.g., Successfully run a simulation for N=40]

### Visualization Plan
* **Plot 1:** [e.g., "Time-to-Solution vs. Problem Size (N)" comparing CPU vs. GPU]
* **Plot 2:** [e.g., "Convergence Rate" (Energy vs. Iteration count) for the Quantum Seed vs. Random Seed]

## 6. Resource Management Plan
**Owner:** GPU Acceleration PIC 

* **Plan:** [How will you avoid burning all your credits?]
    * *Example:* "We will develop entirely on Qbraid (CPU) until the unit tests pass. We will then spin up a cheap L4 instance on Brev for porting. We will only spin up the expensive A100 instance for the final 2 hours of benchmarking."
    * *Example:* "The GPU Acceleration PIC is responsible for manually shutting down the Brev instance whenever the team takes a meal break."
